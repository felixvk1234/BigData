The complete notebook, including detailed explanations and the corresponding code, can be found in "Assignment4_allparties.ipynb."
Additionally, the "party.csv" file, used for Test1 1 to calculate the most frequently used tweets by each party, is also included.
The "hamasisrael.json" file contains the output obtained after running the Cypher query, which we then exported to a GraphML format and processed in Gephi. We used this for Test 2 of this assignment.
